    question: "How does blockchain work?",
    answer: "Think of blockchain as a digital ledger that records every transaction across a network — transparent, decentralized, and tamper-proof.

    icon: <LockClosedIcon className="w-5 h-5" />,
  },
  {
    id: "7",
    question: "How do I keep my crypto safe?",
